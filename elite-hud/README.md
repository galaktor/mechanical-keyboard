My first stab at a custom-designed keyboard. It's for a [61-key VP3 from WASD](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/mechanical-keyboard/wasd-vp3-61-key-custom-mechanical-keyboard.html). I adjusted some of the legends to be more UK-ish (i.e. swap the '@' and '"') and integrated the default layer features for arrows and volume, too.

The design is a retro take on the HUD of sci-fi simulators, specifically [Elite Dangerous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite:_Dangerous).

## Work in progress
I haven't received the keyboard yet, so this could be total rubbish...
