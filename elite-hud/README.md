My first stab at a custom-designed keyboard. It's for a [61-key VP3 from WASD](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/mechanical-keyboard/wasd-vp3-61-key-custom-mechanical-keyboard.html). I adjusted some of the legends to be more UK-ish (i.e. swap the `@` and `"`) and integrated the default layer features for arrows and volume, too.

## Concept
The design is a retro take on the HUD of sci-fi simulators, specifically [Elite Dangerous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite:_Dangerous).

I took some inspriation for the cockpit-style from the [Danger Zone](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/danger-zone-sa-keycap-set) keycap set that was on massdrop a while back.

I wanted a dash of 8-bit nostalgia so I went with a pixel font. The font in question is [Telegrama raw](http://www.yoworks.com/telegrama/index.html) by [YOWorks](http://www.yoworks.com).

## Work in progress
I haven't received the actual keyboard yet, so this could be total rubbish...
