My first stab at a custom-designed keyboard. It's a 61-key VP3 from WASD. I adjusted some of the legends to be more UK-ish (i.e. swap the '@' and '"') and built the default layer features for arrows and volume in, too.

The design is a retro take on the HUD of sci-fi simulators, specifically Elite Dangerous.


## Work in progress
I haven't received the keyboard yet, so this could be total rubbish...
