# CMDR PIXEL

My first stab at a custom-designed keyboard. It's for a [61-key VP3 from WASD](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/mechanical-keyboard/wasd-vp3-61-key-custom-mechanical-keyboard.html). 

## The design
It's a retro-kitsch take on the HUD of a sci-fi simulator game with a dash of 8-bit nostalgia. Terminology loosely based on [Elite Dangerous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite:_Dangerous). Elite uses more orange in the HUDs, but I think the classic black-green sci-fi palette worked better.

Somewhat inspired by the cockpit-style from the [Danger Zone](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/danger-zone-sa-keycap-set) keycap set that was on massdrop a while back.

The font in question is [Telegrama raw](http://www.yoworks.com/telegrama/index.html) by [YOWorks](http://www.yoworks.com).

## Layout features
* swapped the `@` and `"` (more UK-ish)
* dedicated legends for some of the VP3's default layer functions:
  * arrow keys on `JIKL` 
  * volume control on `SDF`
  * default layer selector on `M`
* Emacs `Command` and `Meta` keys where I like them (`CAPS` and `Left-Alt`)
* `0` through `9` in binary
* A red self-destruct button for `ESC`
* Plenty of techno-babble from `Elite: Dangerous`
* Notalgia-licious pixel legends

## Work in progress
The keyboard is in production with WASD - I won't know if this design is any good until the result comes back. You were warned.
